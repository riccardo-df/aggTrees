`aggTrees` is an R package for *aggregation trees*, a nonparametric approach designed to discover heterogeneous subgroups in a selection-on-observables framework. This method helps researchers assess treatment effect heterogeneity by constructing a hierarchical sequence of optimal groupings, enabling estimation and inference at different levels of granularity.

### Key features
âœ” **Data-driven subgroup discovery** for causal inference.
âœ” **Optimal partitions** for identifying treatment effect heterogeneity.
âœ” **Point estimation and inference** for the average treatment effect of each subgroup.
âœ” **Fully nonparametric** â€” no need to pre-specify effect moderators.
âœ” **Seamless integration** with standard econometric workflows.
âœ” **Active development & support** - open-source and actively maintained.                                                          |
