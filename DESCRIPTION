Description: Nonparametric data-driven approach to discovering heterogeneous subgroups in a selection-on-observables framework.
    Aggregation trees allow researchers to assess whether there is relevant heterogeneity in treatment effects. The approach 
    generates a sequence of optimal groupings, one for each level of granularity. For each grouping, we obtain point estimation 
    and inference about the Group Average Treatment Effects. Please reference the use as Di Francesco (2022) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.4304256>.
