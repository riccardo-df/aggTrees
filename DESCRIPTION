Description: A set of functions that work with 'aggTrees' and 'rpart' objects. These functions allow
    the user to investigate how treatment effect heterogeneity varies across different subpopulations
    identified by the leaves of a tree. The user can estimate and conduct inference about the average
    treatment effect in each group and investigare how heterogeneity relates to the observed covariates.
