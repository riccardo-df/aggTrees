Description: Nonparametric data-driven approach to discovering heterogeneous subgroups in a selection-on-observables framework. 
    aggTrees allows researchers to assess whether there exists relevant heterogeneity in treatment effects by generating a sequence of optimal groupings, 
    one for each level of granularity. For each grouping, we obtain point estimation and inference about the Group Average Treatment Effects.
