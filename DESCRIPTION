Description: A set of functions that allows the user to investigate how treatment effect heterogeneity varies across different 
    subpopulations identified by the leaves of an rpart tree (e.g., aggregation trees, causal trees. The user can estimate and 
    conduct inference about the average treatment effect in each group and investigate how heterogeneity relates to the observed covariates.
