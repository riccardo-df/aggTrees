\usage{
estimate_aggtree(object, X, y, D, method = "aipw")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{aggTrees} object.}

\item{X}{Covariate matrix (no intercept).}

\item{y}{Outcome vector.}

\item{D}{Treatment assignment vector.}

\item{method}{Either \code{"raw"} or \code{"aipw"}, defines how leaf predictions are replaced.}
}
\value{
An \code{aggTrees} object.
}
\description{
Replace leaf predictions of a tree stored in an \code{aggTrees} object using external data.
}
\details{
\code{estimate_aggtree} replaces the leaf estimates of a tree as follows. First, it "pushes" all observations in
\code{X} down the tree and finds the leaves where they fall. Then, it replaces the predictions in each leaf according
to the user-specified \code{method}.

If \code{method = "raw"}, \code{estimate_aggtree} replaces leaf predictions with the difference between the sample average
of the observed outcomes of treated units and the sample average of the observed outcomes of control units in each leaf,
which is an unbiased estimator of the GATEs if the assignment to treatment is randomized.\cr

If \code{method = "aipw"}, \code{estimate_aggtree} replaces leaf predictions with the sample average of doubly-robust
scores in each leaf. This is a valid estimator of the GATEs in observational studies. Scores are constructed via
5-fold cross fitting. Honest regression forests are used to estimate the propensity score and the conditional mean
function of the outcome.\cr

\code{estimate_aggtree} allows the user to implement "honest" estimation. If observations in \code{X} have not been
used to construct the tree, then the new predictions are honest in the sense of Athey and Imbens (2016). This allows
the user to conduct valid inference about the estimated GATEs with standard approaches, e.g., by constructing conventional
confidence intervals. To get standard errors for the tree's estimates, please use \code{\link{causal_ols_aggtree}}.\cr

Due to coding limitations, \code{estimate_aggtree} replaces the estimates only in the leaves of a tree. The
internal nodes' estimates are not replaced, so the user should ignore them and focus on the leaves of the tree.\cr
